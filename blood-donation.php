            <hr>
            <p class="text-danger my-2">Who needs blood?</p>
            <p class="text-justify bl-don-content">
                Every 2 seconds someone needs blood. Your blood helps more than one life at a time. Accident victims, premature babies, patients undergoing major surgeries require whole blood, where your blood after testing is used directly. Patients suffering from trauma, anemia, and other surgeries require only red blood cells, which is separated from your blood. The procedure of splitting blood components is called Cytapheresis. Similarly blood platelets are used for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or for those undergoing treatment for dengue fever etc. Fresh frozen plasma is used for patients having massive transfusions, plasma is used for burns and cryoprecipitate is used for hemophilia.
            </p>
            <p class="text-danger my-2">When is blood needed?</p>
            <p class="text-justify bl-don-content">
                Blood is needed at regular intervals and at all times as it has only finite time of storage. Red blood cells can be stored for about 42 days, fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate for 365 days and blood platelets for 5 days.
            </p>
            <p class="text-danger my-2">Who can donate blood?</p>

            <p class="text-justify bl-don-content"># Please accept the snacks offered to you after the donation, it is vital you have them. You are recommended to have a good meal later.</p>
            <p class="text-justify bl-don-content"># Please avoid smoking on the day before donating. You can smoke 3 hours after donation.</p>
            <p class="text-justify bl-don-content"># You will not be eligible to donate blood if you have consumed alcohol 48 hours before donation</p>
            <p class="text-justify bl-don-content"># "MTCT Blood Donors Guild" provides a 360-degree solution to the problem of blood shortage. We work with the objective of saving lives. We act as a channel connecting voluntary donors with those who need blood. We maintain a network with patients, hospitals, and donors.</p>
            <p class="text-justify bl-don-content"># Most patients believe that it is their responsibility to organize blood donors to meet the need. In other words, the search for blood begins after the need has arisen. This naturally would put a lot of pressure on the patient.</p>
            <p class="text-justify bl-don-content"># This also compromises on the safety of blood. It is an established fact that a voluntary blood donor is the safest source of blood.</p>
            <p class="text-justify bl-don-content"># Ideally, the blood units should be present in the Blood Bank before the patient is admitted. Voluntary blood donation drives at venues convenient to donors can easily ensure that this objective is met. This is reassuring to the patient, easy for the donor, and, more importantly, ensures availability of safe blood.</p>
            <p class="text-justify bl-don-content"># Blood Donation gives a proud feeling of touching someoneâ€™s life in such a beautiful way. It is an experience that no words can describe.</p>
