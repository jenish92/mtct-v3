            <p>Mother Teresa Charitable Trust (MTCT)'s history starts with the story of compassion.
              The mammoth crowd that followed the adieu procession of the legend Mother Teresa,
                Dr.G.K.Dhas, a kind hearted social activist took up mother-teresathe challenge of being
                and working for the poor. From this simple, yet heart breaking incident, 
                brought the determination that, to take the mantle of Mother Teresa, that 
                "Service to Mankind is Service to God". The inspiration which helped to create 
                "Mother Teresa Charitable Trust" is being carried out all these years. 
                We took the initiative with the vision that "No one shall be deprived of the basic needs". 
                The overwhelming response from the general public is the impetus for the growth of Mother 
                Teresa Charitable Trust. Now Mother Teresa Charitable Trust functions as a social relief 
                NGO striving for the upliftment of poor, sick, downtrodden and the under privileged. 
                The vision of the Mother Teresa Charitable Trust is to spread the ideals of Mother 
                Teresa and motivate the younger generation to render service to the less fortunate. 
                Its sub unit "Mother Teresa Forum" enrolls members and forms committees at national state, 
                district, taluk and village levels. Mother Teresa Charitable Trust serves with the motto of 
                "Service to Humanity". With the partnership of Government & various State governments, 
                as well as the generosity of thousands of our supporters, we have grown from a small 
                endeavor to a mammoth force that stretches across the wide chemesphere . 
                All these years MTCT serve the under privileged and the needy to transform a vision into a reality. Our fight will continue till the last breath of a suffering mass.</p>

She left a testament of unshakable faith, invincible hope and extraordinary charity as a mother of the poor. She became a living symbol of compassion to the world, and a living witness to the thirsting love. Mother Teresa's work has been recognized and acclaimed throughout the world.

          <div id="short-profile-more">
            <p>Mother Teresa Charitable Trust is a humanitarian development and social relief NGO striving for the upliftment of the poor and downtrodden irrespective of caste, creed or religion. It is a secular, apolitical and non-profit organization that came into existence with a mission to serve the poorest of the poor by the inspiration derived from the life and service of Mother Teresa. Mother Teresa Forum (MTF) the sub unit of Mother Teresa Charitable Trust has operations throughout the Indian sub-continent. MTF has seen commendable growth during the recent years, and we see many passionate youngsters coming forward and joining us in this long journey of serving the poor.</p>

                on conducting events in their respective areas to enrich knowledge on communication skill, leadership qualities, hygiene, moral studies and employment opportunities.</p>

            <p>To motivate the future generation to render service and sow the seed of love throughout the world under the footsteps of Mother Teresa, irrespective of caste, creed, religion or political affiliation.</p>
            <h6>OUR MISSION:</h6>
            <p>To achieve sustained social and economic changes in the community we serve, fulfilling hallow areas that are poorly addressed, excellence in community service through up gradation of skills, effective participation of its volunteers making use of state of the art technology.</p>
            <h6>EDUCATION:</h6>
            <p>In India forty million children do not attend primary school. Only one-third of all children complete their mandatory 8 years of education. Education is one of the most important factors in the alleviation of poverty in India and is one of the most precious gift one can give to a child.</p>
            <p>Mother Teresa Charitable Trust strives hard to break the barriers towards acquisition of education for the deprived & underprivileged section. Children are the future pillars of our nation and irrespective of the socio-economic background every child has the right to education.</p>
            <p>Mother Teresa Charitable Trust provides free school books / notes / bags and educational scholarships and assistance to the poor school going children. We conduct evening tuition centers in various parts of India. School going poor children come to these centers where they will be trained in their own academics and other extracurricular activities. We provide regular counseling and motivate children to pursue higher education.</p>
            <h6>SKILL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING :</h6>
            <p>India is expected to be home to a skilled workforce of 500 million by 2022. About 12 million persons are expected to join the workforce every year. The good news is that India has one of the youngest populations in the world, a trend that is expected to continue until 2040. This presents the country with a unique opportunity to complement what an ageing world needs the most and that is a large pool of productive workers. India has the potential to become a powerhouse with the population set to rise to 1.3 billion by 2020, out of which 60% are in the working age of (15-59 years). Only 10% of the total workforce in the country receives some kind of skill training (2% with formal training and 8% with informal training). Further, 80% of the entrants into the workforce do not have the opportunity for skill training. Realizing the skill gap in our country and to empower the marginalized section of the society, MTCT has its skill development programs.</p>
            <p>Mother Teresa Charitable Trust train young boys and girls in technical skills and handicrafts by which many students have benefited and their lives empowered after learning the crafts of tailoring, techniques in computers and tactics of food processing. We run free computer centers in several parts of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra and free tailoring classes in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. This project seeks to promote employment to young unemployed women, which incorporates three aspects namely skill imparting, entrepreneurship development and marketing, through a well-defined curriculum and schedule. Follow up of youths for successful placement after completing courses also forms a very vital part of the project. MTCT also conducted Govt. of India sponsored EDP Programs from Ministry of Food Processing Industries by which more than 300 young entrepreneurs have benefited.</p>
            <h6>HEALTH & HYGINE:</h6>
            <p>Unlike cities, adequate and good quality medical facilities are not available in the rural areas. Tie-ups with government and private hospitals are sought and health camps are organized from time to time. Health awareness camps and health education classes are conducted on a regular basis for urban and rural people. World Health Organization (WHO) sponsored "Anti-Tobacco Programs" in Puducherry , Karaikal and Andaman Nicobar Islands for students, general public and Govt officials to create awareness on the ill-effects of tobacco consumption, was conducted by the trust. MTCT also conducts regular health check-up camps for the students and the general public. The focus is on early detection and prevention. Students are educated on hygiene parameters. This also helps in sensitizing the public about healthy lifestyles. Blood donation Camps, Eye Camps, Dental camps, and other Health programs are conducted at regular intervals in different places.</p>

            <p>Our free ambulance service is being operated in collaboration with the CSI Medical Mission Hospital, Neyyoor , Kanyakumari District .It is being used for Mobile cancer detection camps in Tamil Nadu.</p>

              <h3>Women Empowerment</h3>
              <p>Women in India consistently lag behind men in terms of access to education, health care, jobs etc. Apart from the economic and social inequality, women are victims of heinous crimes such as dowry deaths, rape, molestation and immoral trafficking. The reasons could be varied for various women, some women could be deprived of these opportunities because their men don't want them to work, the others may be restricted due to family pressures or peer pressures. Of the 1.3 billion people who live in absolute poverty around the globe, 70 percent are women. For these women, poverty doesn’t 't just mean scarcity and want. It means rights denied, opportunities curtailed and voices silenced. We believe that an empowered woman can change a lot in the society.</p>
