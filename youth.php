            <p>Youth is the future. A brave, frank, clean- hearted, courageous and aspiring youth is the only foundation on which the future nation can be built.”--Swami Vivekananda Youth (aged 15 to 24) continue to face major employment challenges. Indeed, youth are three and a half times more likely than adults to be unemployed, with a global unemployment rate of 11.8 per cent. Increased efforts to reduce that rate are urgently needed to meet Sustainable Development. Moreover, youth are disproportionally represented in the informal economy, which seldom offers social protection and is associated with precarious and hazardous jobs. More than one in three young workers in low and middle-income countries was living in extreme or moderate, which foresees slowing global growth, On the one hand, youth are overrepresented among workers in jobs that are not sustainable or that are damaging the environment and that will be eliminated during the transition to green economies, as well as in seasonal occupations in sectors impacted by climate change.

            <p>As an increasing number of employers are adopting complex technologies, youth who are marginalized, such as those with disabilities, young migrants, rural youth or young women, are at risk of being left behind as they may not be able to access the relevant education and training that this type of work requires. It is sometimes incorrectly assumed that all youth are digital natives and that they therefore have the skills to enable them to participate in the new world of frontier technologies and artificial intelligence. Youth need adapted education and training to reduce the risks of an increasing digital divide. ’A time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and eeducation is the manifestation of the perfection already in man.

            <p> Rural Self-Employment Training Institutes are promoted for the purpose of providing opportunities to the rural youth for their skill up gradation leading to self-employment. The training programmes are entirely free of cost. On an average, we offer around 3-4 skill development programmes on different areas in a year. All the programmes are of short duration ranging preferably from 3 to 6 weeks. This scheme aims at providing basic technical and entrepreneurial skill to the rural poor in the age group of 18 - 35 yrs. and thus enables them to take up income generating activities. The training includes free computer coaching, free tailoring units, designing, art candle making, catering etc. Out of the total beneficiaries 50% are women. The Our training centers are well equipped with component trainers. Be with us in supporting this youth folk.
