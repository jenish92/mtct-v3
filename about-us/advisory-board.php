                An advisory board is a body that provides non-binding strategic advice to the management of an organization. The informal nature of an advisory board gives greater flexibility in structure and management. Though the advisory board does not have authority to vote, their role is to give proper guidance for the effective implementation of the objects of the trust for the benefit of the general public. Asking for advice is an act of humility. MTCT is having two excellent stalwarts in their board as advisors..
