The trustee must act impartially between individual beneficiaries as well as between different classes of beneficiaries, be loyal and administer in the best interest of the beneficiaries. Trust is like a mirror. Trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair. Trust starts with truth and ends with truth.
