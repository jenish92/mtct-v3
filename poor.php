            <p>One in eight women, men and children go to bed hungry every night and by 2025 nearly a billion young people will face poverty because of the damage done to them now through hunger and malnutrition. Hunger remains the No.1 cause of death in the world. There are 820 million chronically hungry people in the world. Million Indians survive on less than Rs. 20/- a day. Over 20 crores Indians will sleep hungry one night. Over 7000 Indians die of hunger every day and over 25 lakh Indians die of hunger every year. Despite substantial improvement in health since independence and a growth rate of 8 percent in recent years, under-nutrition remains a silent emergency in India, with almost 50 percent of Indian children underweight and more than 70 percent of the women and children with serious nutritional deficiencies as anemia. The number of hungry people in India is always more than the number of people below official poverty line. Mother Teresa charitable trust and its execution wing volunteers try to help this section of society in various parts of the country. Support us so that we can alleviate poverty and try to provide food for this fragile section of the society. <a href="donation/index.php">Join Now..</a>
