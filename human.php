            <p> In India human rights is an issue complicated by the country's large size, its tremendous diversity, its status as a developing country and a sovereign, secular, democratic republic. The Constitution of India provides for fundamental rights, which include freedom of speech, education and religion. Human Rights are rights inherent to all human beings, whatever be our nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, language or any other status, we are all equally entitled to our human rights without discrimination. India, the world 's most populous democracy, continues to have significant human rights problems despite making commitments to tackle some of the most prevalent abuses. The country has a thriving civil society, free media, and an independent judiciary. But longstanding abusive practices, corruption, and lack of accountability for perpetrators foster human rights violations. Mother Teresa Charitable trust takes positive actions to facilitate the enjoyment of basic human rights. Join us in this journey.
