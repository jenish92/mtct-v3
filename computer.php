            <p>Computer is so powerful a resource that it can be programmed to simulate the instructional process, which include learning to use and get information in the social sciences from a large database inquiry system, or to simulate an ecological system, or to solve problems by using algorithms, or to acquire laboratory data and analyze it, or to represent textual information for editing and analysis, or to represent musical information for analysis, or to create and process graphical information etc. These uses of computers in education cause students to become masters of computing, not merely its subjects. Training is teaching, or developing in oneself or others, any skills and knowledge or fitness that relate to specific useful competencies. Training has specific goals of improving one's capability, capacity, productivity and performance. In addition to the basic training required for a trade, occupation or profession, training may continue beyond initial competence to maintain, upgrade and update skills throughout working life. People within some professions and occupations may refer to this sort of training as professional development.
