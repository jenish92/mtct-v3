            <p>W omen in India consistently lag behind men in terms of access to education, health care, jobs etc. Apart from the economic and social inequality, women are victims of heinous crimes such as dowry deaths, rape, molestation and immoral trafficking. The reasons could be varied for various women, some women could be deprived of these opportunities because their men don't want them to work, the others may be restricted due to family pressures or peer pressures. Of the 1.3 billion people who live in absolute poverty around the globe, 70 percent are women. For these women, poverty doesnâ€™t 't just mean scarcity and want. It means rights denied, opportunities curtailed and voices silenced. We believe that an empowered woman can change a lot in the society. We believe in practical steps to create income for women, who are capable, intelligent and willing to work. MTCT is working at the grass root level to empower women to attain economic participation in order to overcome poverty and inequality. We solicit your support for this effort by contributing to this cause and thus help empowerment of marginalized women. We also support poor women to start business and make their livelihood. For this we offer up to Rs. 10,000/- free of interest repayable within 20 months. Let us also lend a helping hand to these oppressed section by joining with this cause.
