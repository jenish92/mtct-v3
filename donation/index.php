              <p>Women in India consistently lag behind men in terms of access to education, health care, jobs etc. Apart from the economic and social inequality, women are victims of heinous crimes such as dowry deaths, rape, molestation and immoral trafficking. The reasons could be varied for various women, some women could be deprived of these opportunities because their men don't want them to work, the others may be restricted due to family pressures or peer pressures. Of the 1.3 billion people who live in absolute poverty around the globe, 70 percent are women. For these women, poverty doesn’t 't just mean scarcity and want. It means rights denied, opportunities curtailed and voices silenced. We believe that an empowered woman can change a lot in the society.</p>
