            <p>Education opens up the mind, expands it and allows us to improve our life in so many ways. The purpose of school is to develop and exercise students' potential for reasoning, form ethical character, and provide a skill and knowledge base. It is also to develop dispositions and habits that exercise reason and forming a human's ethos. Education is an attempt to find the kind of unity of doing and making that enables individuals to grow, ethically and socially. An intelligent heart acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge. Let us start where we are, use what we have and do what we can. Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today

            <p>Education is the basic need of the society. Mother Teresa Charitable trust extends its helping hand to those who are deprived of the basic education in whatever way it is possible. We also initiate students of college/universities to form five member teams under Mother Teresa Forum banner, and take care of the poor students who need help on food, boarding, clothes, books, fees etc. We focus on children from low income communities enabling them to maximize their potential and change their lives. By this mission, we are confident that thousands of underprivileged children will have a bright future. You can be a part of our educational journey. Mother Teresa Forum volunteers undertake free tuition center in villages and slum areas to educate and train the underprivileged in the society, to compete with the affluent sections. Let us join in the Mission to serve the needy students.
